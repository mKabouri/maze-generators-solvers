# maze-generator-solver

## Motivation:
I really like mazes. This is the main motivation behind chosing this project. My goal is to have a small modular library for maze generator algorithms and solvers.

## Description:
The project goal is to generates mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and solves them using the A* (A STAR) search algorithm. The application is built using Pygame, allowing for real-time visualization of both maze generation and the solving process.

## Demonstration:

![MAZE GENERATOR AND SOLVER](./gen_solver.gif)

## Commands:
To run the project:
```
python ./src/run.py
```

You can edit config.py file for your personal settings.

You can use `Q` to quit the pygame window.

## Improvements:
- Implementing additional maze generation algorithms (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's ...).
- A metric to compare the complexity of generated mazes.
- Adding more solving algorithms (e.g., Tr√©maux's algorithm ...).
- Enhancing the user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Introducing difficulty levels and customizable maze sizes.
