# maze-generator-solver

## Motivation:
This project was created as a comprehensive application to demonstrate the capabilities of maze generation and solving algorithms. The main motivation behind this project is to explore the fundamentals of algorithm design and visualization using Python and Pygame, and to provide an interactive and educational tool for understanding these algorithms.

## Description:
The Maze Generator and Solver is a Python application that generates mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and solves them using the A* search algorithm. The application is built using Pygame, allowing for real-time visualization of both maze generation and the solving process.

## Demonstration:


## Commands:
To run the Maze Generator and Solver, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and run the main script:
4. Use the following keyboard commands within the application:
- `Q`: Quit the application
- Other commands...

## Improvements:
Future improvements planned for this project include:
- Implementing additional maze generation algorithms (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's).
- Adding more solving algorithms (e.g., BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm).
- Enhancing the user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Introducing difficulty levels and customizable maze sizes.
