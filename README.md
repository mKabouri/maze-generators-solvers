# maze-generator-solver

## Motivation:
I really like mazes. This is the main motivation behind chosing this project. My goal is to have a small modular library for maze generator algorithms and solvers.

## Description:
The project goal is to generates mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and solves them using the A* (A STAR) search algorithm. The application is built using Pygame, allowing for real-time visualization of both maze generation and the solving process.

## Demonstration:

## Commands:
To run the project:
```
python ./src/run.py
```
4. Use the following keyboard commands within the application:
- `Q`: Quit the application
- Other commands...

## Improvements:
Future improvements planned for this project include:
- Implementing additional maze generation algorithms (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's).
- Adding more solving algorithms (e.g., BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm).
- Enhancing the user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Introducing difficulty levels and customizable maze sizes.
